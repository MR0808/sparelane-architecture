# INT-PSP-006 — Provider transaction lookup

## Requirement

The PSP interface must allow Sparelane to look up provider transaction status to resolve unknown outcomes.

## Rationale

Defines required provider interface capabilities for vendor evaluation. Does not select a vendor.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Capability is expressible as an adapter interface in implementation blueprints.
- Unknown/timeout behaviours have a safe reconciliation path where money movement is involved.

## Notes

Vendors remain open decisions.

## Implementation evidence (Phase D)

`implementationStatus: foundation_implemented` for adapter/FakePSP capability evidence only. Vendor selection OD-008/010 open. Not real-PSP verified. Architecture `status` remains **accepted**. See [phase-d-status](../../docs/implementation/phase-d-status.md).
